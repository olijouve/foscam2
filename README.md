# foscam2
Custom component for Foscam camera with zoom support

This is a temporary fork of home assitant foscam integration for supporting zoom operations.

As it involve an update of the libpyfoscam, I'm waiting for its maintainer to merge my PR:
https://github.com/viswa-swami/python-foscam/pull/3

Off course this component will be pushed back to Home assistant repository when libpyfoscam will be ready for it.

In the meantime and for testing purposes, the python libpyfoscam module is embedded.
